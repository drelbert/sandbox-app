  most commom = webpack

  more easy to set up = parcel

  others = Snowpack, Rollup

# start

- npm run dev

# code style

- keep the PR for high level architecture
  not nitpicking

# code formatting

- reformatting code
  Prettier

  npm install and
  add the file
  with just {} for no configurations

- editorconfig

# linting

- eslint and prettier overlap

- prettier is syntax centric, but has nothing to do with variables and functions

- eslint handles how the code works

  - see the Air B n B guidelines

- note on use
  for bugs and making sure code is production ready

# testing

- write tests using jest

  see notes for install

# typeScript

- rewrite the app in TypeScript

# init

- the entry point for the project

# State machine

- method for writing code to track variables

- tracking of various states
  sleeping
  eating
  idle
  and so on

- use inumerated type

- UI
  practice
  one css for one js file
